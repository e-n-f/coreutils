/*
This module handles reading and parsing multibyte sequences from a file
(either FILE* or file-descriptor) using a fixed-sized buffer.
*/

#include "multibyte.h"

/*
Typical usage:

    struct mbbuf mbb;
    mbbuf_init (&mbb, BUFSIZ);
    FILE* f = fopen(...)

    while (mbbuf_getchar (&mbb, f))
      {
        // 'mbb' contains the information about the parsed sequence:
        //   mbb.mb_str   : the multibyte sequence (valid or invalid)
        //   mbb.mb_len   : number of octets pointed by mb_str.
        //   mbb.mb_valid : True if the sequence is valid (including if NUL).
        //   mbb.wc       : if mb_valid, the wide-char equivalent of 'mb_str'.
      }

    if (mbb.err)
      error (1, errno, ...)

    mbbuf_free (&mbb);
    fclose (f)

Same as above, with file-descriptors:

    int fd = open(....)
    while (mbbuf_fd_getchar(&mbb, fd))
      {
        ...
      }

Same as above, with automatic detection of optimal I/O buffer size:

    const char* filename = "....";
    struct mbbuf mbb;
    FILE* f = fopen(...)
    mbbuf_init_file (&mbb, f, filename);
    while (mbbuf_getchar (&mbb, f))
      {
        ...
      }

The 'mbbuf_filepos' struct keeps track of
file-offset, line number and byte/char position in line,
based on content of 'struct mbb'.

It is kept separately from 'struct mbbuf' to avoid
wasting time counting if no counting/reporting is needed.

Typical usage (buidling upon example above):

    struct mbbuf mbb;
    struct mbbuf_filepos mbfp;

    mbbuf_init (&mbb, BUFSIZ);
    mbbuf_filepos_init (&mbfp);

    FILE* f = fopen(...)

        // and with the information in MBFP.

        // MBFP contains the following values:
        //   mbfp->fileofs:  file-offset in bytes. 0 = first byte of file.
        //   mbfp->linenum:  current line. 1 = first line.
        //   mbfp->col_byte: current BYTE offset in the current line.
        //                   1 = first byte in the line.
        //   mbfp->col_char: current multibyte CHAR in the current line.
        //                   1 = first character in the line.
