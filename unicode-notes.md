TODO: UTF-16 Surrogates:
  1. printf can generate them, but on wchar_t/64-bit systems,
     mbrtowc(3) can't decode them:
       $ printf '\ud800\n' | iconv -f utf-8
       iconv: illegal input sequence at position 0

  2. A file containing:
       printf '\ud800\udc000\n' > 1.txt
     will be interpreted as 6 invalid octets on 64bit systems,
     and as either 'U+100000' or 'U+D800 U+DC00' on cygwin.
     which is correct ?

  3. On Cygwin, this input can be detected (and rejected to maintain
     consistency) by checking mbstate_t.__count==4 .
     What about other systems ?

Converting UTF to \U sequences (using 'uconv' from ICU packagE):

    $ printf "Œ£Œ∑ŒºŒµ·øñœåŒΩ" | uconv -x 'hex-any ; any-hex' ; echo
    \u03A3\u03B7\u03BC\u03B5\u1FD6\u03CC\u03BD

Converting UTF-8 to named unicode charactes:

    $ printf "Œ£Œ∑ŒºŒµ·øñœåŒΩ" | uconv -x 'hex-any ; any-name' ; echo
    \N{GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA}\N{GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA}
    \N{GREEK SMALL LETTER MU}\N{GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON}
    \N{GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI}
    \N{GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH TONOS}\N{GREEK SMALL LETTER NU}

List of possible transliterations in 'uconv'/ICU:

     uconv -L | tr ' ' '\n' | grep -i any | sort -f |  less

eg.
    uconv -x 'hex-any ; any-hex/perl'
    uconv -x 'hex-any ; any-hex/java'
    uconv -x 'hex-any ; any-hex/c'


Print unicode:

   perl -e 'print "\x{3A3}\n"
   perl -e 'print "\N{U+03A3}\n"
   perl -e 'print "\N{GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA}\n"

   printf '\u03A3\n'
   printf '\U000003A3\n'






Show different unicode font implementation/support in terminals:

1. Easy case: 'e' + combining mark (where a pre-combined 'e' exists):

     $ printf 'e\u0301\n'
     √©

   Works on gnome-terminal, mac-os-x-terminal, xterm.
   doesn't work on 'st' (simple-terminal from st.suckless.org),
   prints 'e' followed by empty 'grave'.

2. Advanced support: any letter (regardless of pre-combined letter
   support:

      $ printf 'x\u0301e\n'

   On gnome-terminal,mac-os-terminal, prints 'x' with grave
   (nonsensical, but graphically correct) followed by 'b'.

   On xterm, simple-term: prints 'xe'

            to the Latin-Extended-B 'DZ' latter?
      up to and including:
      \u2AB Latin Small Letter LZ Digraph


   on gnome-terminal, the 'DZ' is rendered as two characters,
   but following character ('a') is rendered ON TOP of the 'Z' -
   the 'DZ' did not consume two spaces:
       $ printf '\u01c4a\n'

   see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%BE

What about wcwidth of "full width" characters:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfwidth_and_fullwidth_forms#In_Unicode
    e.g.
       \uFF21 full-width capital A

   On glibc, wcwidth gives 2 (which is great):

     (or technically, only cut in clear graphmeme? e.g. never before ZWJ, BIDI mark, etc.)?

Page 438: 'interlinear' markers.


tr
==

Uppercase mapping of ligatures turns into TWO letters?

e.g:
    U+FB01 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI (Ô¨Å)
    printf '\uFB01' |

POSIX says this must work,
in "Extended DEscription" under:
" Multi-byte characters require multiple, concatenated escape sequences of this type, including the leading <backslash> for each byte."

  $ printf "\xc3\xA4\n" | gtr '\xc3\xa4' X
  √§


Chracter Ranges are UNDEFINED in non-posix locale:
"c-c"
   "In locales other than the POSIX locale, this construct has unspecified behavior."

What does this mean??
"The ISO POSIX-2:1993 standard had a -c option that behaved similarly to the -C option, but did not supply functionality equivalent to the -c option specified in POSIX.1-2008.

The earlier version also said that octal sequences referred to collating elements and could be placed adjacent to each other to specify multi-byte characters. However, it was noted that this caused ambiguities because tr would not be able to tell whether adjacent octal sequences were intending to specify multi-byte characters or multiple single byte characters. POSIX.1-2008 specifies that octal sequences always refer to single byte binary values when used to specify an endpoint of a range of collating elements.
"

      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Invalid_code_points :
      ------
      Since RFC 3629 (November 2003), the high and low
      surrogate halves used by UTF-16 (U+D800 through U+DFFF) and code
      points not encodable by UTF-16 (those after U+10FFFF) are not
      legal Unicode values, and their UTF-8 encoding must be treated
      as an invalid byte sequence.

      Not decoding surrogate halves makes it impossible to store
      invalid UTF-16, such as Windows filenames, as UTF-8. Therefore,
      detecting these as errors is often not implemented and there are
      attempts to define this behavior formally (see WTF-8 and CESU
      below).

  Section3.3  Sequences with last continuation byte missing:

    All bytes of an incomplete sequence should be signalled as a single
    malformed sequence, i.e., you should see only a single replacement
    character in each of the next 10 tests. (Characters as in section 2).

  Mbbuffer currently reports EACH invalid octet instead
  of just one per incomplete sequence.

  TODO: Does incomplete sequence in the middle of the file
  reported as incomplete (mbrtowc==-2) or invalid (mbrtowc==-1) ?

  If we report on the FIRST octet (including line,byte/char offset),
  the user (needing low-level processing) won't be able to tell
  the differences without further processing. By reporting
  all octets, we provide easier work-arounds
  (but we also 'pollute' stdout with more "invalid char" markers
  than needed). Perhaps add this as an option?

  On Ubuntu 14.04 with xterm 322, terminal prints only one "invalid char":
    $ printf '\ud800\n'
    ÔøΩ

  On Ubuntu 14.04 with gnome-terminal 3.6.2, nothing is printf.

  Mac OS X terminal prints 3 question marks:
    $ printf '\ud800\n'
    ???

  Web browsers print 3 characters:
    visit https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/examples/UTF-8-test.txt
    and view section 5.1.1.
  On Linux: Google Chrom 51.0, Firefox 48.0
  On Mac: Safari 8.0.7, Chrome 47.0, IceCat 37.0

  $ printf '\367\277\277\n' | ./src/mbbuffer-test.exe -r
  ofs  line colB colC V wc(dec) wc(hex) Ch  W n octets
  0    1    1    1    n       *       * *   * 1 0xf7
  1    1    2    2    n       *       * *   * 1 0xbf
  2    1    3    3    n       *       * *   * 1 0xbf
  3    1    4    4    y      10 0x0000a =  -1 1 0x0a



Also see seciont 5.1 (Single UTF-16 surrogates)
  where he claims each invalid sequence should result in ONE
  "invalid character" output:
  e.g.
       5.1.1  U+D800 = ed a0 80 = "ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ"
  In such cases 'mbrtowc' return -1 THREE times (or is it because
  we reset mbstate_t after each failure?)
